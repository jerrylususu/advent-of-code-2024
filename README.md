my solutions for advent of code 2024

- pysrc: python solutions (handwritten, mostly)
- src: rust solutions (llm generated)
- data: input data for solutions (from my personal account)

(still learning rust, so the code is not optimized and probably not rust idiomatic)

```py
# may need input.txt at root folder
python pysrc/day2p2.py
```

```rs
cargo run --bin day2

cargo test --bin day2
```
